## About the sessions

This block of the course has been designed as a theoretical-practical workshop in which participants will be introduced to some statistical techniques using the freely distributed statistical software R. Since this is a programming language and learning it can be difficult, numerous examples will be used to facilitate the mastery of the basic syntax. Throughout the sessions, students will be trained to be autonomous in basic techniques related to data visualization, statistical decision making, statistical modeling, as well as in the elaboration of technical reports with R tools. Given the eminently practical nature of the course, it should be held in a computer classroom or each student should bring a laptop computer.

### Teaching plan:

1. Correlation tests (2h)
 - Pearson's correlation tests
 - Spearmans's correlation tests
 - Kendall's correlation tests

2. Linear regression models (4h)
 - Simple and multiple linear regression models 
 - Models diagnostics
 - Qualitative predictors
 - Introduction to polynomial regression

3. Mediation and moderation models (4h)
 - Mediation models
 - Moderation models

4. APA guidelines for reporting research results (2h)
 - APA style
 - References
 - Reporting tables and figures

## About the lecturer

My name is David Leiva and I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Social Psychology and Quantitative Psychology. I teach undergraduate, masters and doctoral courses in Statistics, Research Techniques, Statistical Modeling, Data Science and Applied Mathematics. My main research interests are dyadic data analysis, modeling behavior and statistical software. I have also participated in numerous works in fields such as Organizational Psychology, Neuropsychology, Psychogerontology or Biology, among others. You can find my CV in the following [link](https://github.com/DLEIVA/CV/blob/main/CV_DLU_2025_ENG.pdf).

## Previous steps

Please make sure that you have at least version 4.4 if R installed &mdash; *and preferably version 4.5.1* &mdash; (as depending on the packages used they require updated versions of the software). Note that R and RStudio are two different programs: it is not sufficient to have an updated version of RStudio as R is updated independently on a regular basis.

To check the version of R installed, you can run

```r
version
```

in R and read in the `version.string` section (or the `major` and `minor` sections).

If the installed version of R is < 4.4.0, you will need to upgrade the program after downloading and installing it. To download R go to the [CRAN Download page](https://cran.r-project.org/) and select the appropriate link for your operating system:

* [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/)
* [MacOS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
* [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)

Throughout the sessions we will be using various R packages that you will need to have installed. Before the course starts, run the following code which will update the installed packages and install the packages needed during the course:

```r
# Update packages
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)

# Some packages to be installed
pkgs <- c('usethis','haven','tidyverse','car','here','boot','effects','lmtest','DiagrammeR','interactions','compareGroups','apaTables','dslabs','ggthemes','ggrepel','ggstatsplot','patchwork')

# Install these packages
install.packages(pkgs, Ncpus = 4) # Specify Ncpus depending on the number of available CPUs
```

*It is advisable to work on these 2 resources beforehand in order to make the most of the course.*

# Course Materials

## From Github

To download the course materials you can open RStudio and run `use_course()` as shown below:

```r
usethis::use_course("DLEIVA/ResearchMethodsCyber")
```

Once the instruction is executed you will be asked if you want to download the course materials to the `~/Desktop` directory (in this case, `~/` refers to your root directory). Press the indicated number and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to show your agreement. The materials will be downloaded as a zip file and extracted automatically.

After extraction, you will be asked if you want to delete the downloaded `.zip` file. Select the option you think is appropriate.

Finally, after answering this question, Rstudio will load the course project in a new RStudio session. Once the project is open, you can close the other RStudio window (where you have executed the `use_course()` instruction).

### Direct download

If you are not using RStudio or know what you are doing, you can download the zip file directly from <https://github.com/DLEIVA/ResearchMethodsCyber.git>. Extracting files and starting in the correct directory will then be up to you.
